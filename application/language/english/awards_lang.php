There is no minimum signal report required. Contacts must be made from the same location, or from locations no two of which are more than 200 kilometers apart. The applicantâ€™s attestation in the award application serves as affirmation of abidance to the distance rule. Individuals may apply for and be granted multiple GridMaster awards, when achieved from another location, which is in a different 200-kilometer circle.";
